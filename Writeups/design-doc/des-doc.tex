%% Section 1
\section{Design Stakeholders and Their Concerns}

The primary stakeholder in this project is David Konerding of Google.
He is one of the managers of the Eclipse Megamovie project that is sponsoring
this Senior Capstone project. David Konerding's concerns are listed below.

\subsection{Image Processor}

\subsubsection{}

The image process needs to take in an image, identify if the image has a total
solar eclipse, and if it does further process it so that it can be stitched into
a timelapse movie by Eclipse Megamovie engineers. \\

\subsubsection{}

The mean processing time for an image must be one second. \\

\subsubsection{}

Images must be processed in no longer than five seconds.\\

\subsubsection{}

Images must be filtered so that the processed images are only images of the
eclipse at totality.\\

\subsubsection{}

Only high quality images, defined as having a 50 pixel solar disk size and
padding around the disk of 100 pixels, should be accepted by the image
processor.\\

\subsubsection{}

Once images have been filtered, they need to have metadata attached in a way
that allows easy stitching of eclipse images. \\

\subsubsection{}

The image processor needs to be able to be called by the image processor manager
with appropriate input data. \\

\subsubsection{}

Image processor needs to be able to use GPS EXIF information associated with
images.\\

\subsection{Image Processor Manager}

    \subsubsection{}
    Image processor manager should download images needing processing
    from Google Cloud Storage. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    Image processor manager should invoke image processor with downloaded images. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    Image processor manager should upload processed images and corresponding metadata
    - the output from the image processor - to Google Cloud Storage and Datastore, respectively. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    Image processor should download/upload images at the same time the image processor
    is processing other images. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    Image processor manager should invoke multiple image processor instances concurrently
    with different input images. The number of image processor instances launched should be
    determined by the number of cores on the host VM. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    Image processor manager instances should be able to run alongside other image processor
    manager instances running on (potentially) different machines. These discrete instances should
    not attempt to process the same images. \\

\subsection{Eclipse Simulator}
    \subsubsection{}
    The solar eclipse must be accurately simulated based on
    user entered location information. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    Users will be able to adjust simulator time via a
    draggable slider or clickable buttons. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    Simulator will only support locations within continental
    United States. \\

    \subsubsection{}
    The simulator must load in less than 500ms given a 1-10
    Mbps internet connection. \\

\section{Design Views}

\subsection{Image Processor}

\subsubsection{Speed and Performance [Governed by Viewpoint 2.1.1]}

The Eclipse Megamovie project expects to receive photographs on the order of
hundreds of thousands from the numerous citizen photographers registered with
the project. This being the case, it is of utmost importance that the image
processor we are building for the project can process images in a timely manner.
This is not only important to being able to build a movie from the images soon
after the eclipse, but also because it prevents storage spaces on either end of
the image processing pipeline from becoming clogged. \\

In order to achieve these design goals, we are designing a system that uses the
OpenCV C++ library.  This API provides us with high performing library methods,
like Hough transforms, image crops, and image rotations that are necessary to
the image processor's core functionality. In addition to the use of this
language and library, we are also designing this system to be single threaded
but to also interface with a manager that runs multiple instances of the image
processor concurrently. This fact allows us to design the image process to
process a single image quickly and accurately and leaves management of the
application to a different art of the system.\\

\subsubsection{Accuracy [Governed by Viewpoint 2.1.2]}

From a high level, the most fundamental concern in the design of the image
processor is that it can accurately identify an eclipse image. The other
concerns associated with the design of the image processor are near meaningless
if the application is not consistently identifying images that contain total
eclipse.\\

To address this concern, and the related concerns around accepting only high
quality images and determining the relative temporal and spatial positioning of
images, we are designing this application with accuracy as a primary goal. The
meet this goal, the system will build upon an existing eclipse identification
algorithm. This algorithm, with improvements we add ourselves, will be the basis
for the parts of the system that we design to meet the accuracy requirements of
the image processor.\\

\subsubsection{Input and Output [Governed by Viewpoint 2.1.3]}

The image processor is one component in a much larger system. For the system to
function the image processor needs to interface with the other components in a
well defined and seamless manner. In addition to speed and accuracy, we need to
design the system with a view toward optimizing the way the image processor
interacts with other components.\\

The ensure a smooth interface with the image processor manager we are designing
the image processor to accept a well defined set of command line arguments
including the path to the list of images to be processed, the path to an output
directory, and the path to prefix image file names with that points to their
location. The design of the image processor also takes into account the needs of
the engineers handling the processed images. The image processor will write
processed images and their metadata in a specific format to an output file.\\

\subsection{Image Processor Manager}

    \subsubsection{Maximal Utilization [Governed by viewpoint 2.2.1]}
    It is the goal of the image processor manager to maximize hardware utilization on the VMs on which it is
    running. This means that ideally, the VMs where the image processor manager and therefore the image
    processor are running will have an average of 100\% CPU utilization on all cores at all times.The image
    processor application will be single threaded and thus by invoking multiple instances of this application,
    the image processor manager can increase utilization on multiple CPU cores. \\

    The downloading of images to process and uploading of processed images are both very high latency
    operations. Therefore, instead of waiting for these downloads/uploads to complete with virtually zero CPU
    utilization in the meantime, the image processor manager can achieve greater average CPU utilization by
    completing these high latency tasks concurrently to processing other images. \\

    \subsubsection{Image Processing [Governed by viewpoint 2.2.2]}
    The ultimate goal of the image processor manager is to facilitate the processing of eclipse images by the
    image processor component of this project. This can be achieved by downloading images to process from the
    cloud, assembling them into a form that can be consumed by the image processor and then invoking that
    application with the downloaded images as input data. \\

    \subsubsection{Synchronization [Governed by viewpoint 2.2.3]}
    The image processor must process the images that are uploaded by users. These images are uploaded by the
    eclipsemega.movie website to Google Cloud Storage and metadata entries are also created for them in Google
    Cloud Datastore. In order for the image processor manager to invoke the image processor with these images,
    it must download them from Google Cloud. \\

    The application to stitch processed images into movies, being developed by Google, expects to find
    processed eclipse images in Google Cloud Storage with corresponding metadata in Google Cloud Datastore. In
    order to meet this expectation, the image processor manager must upload the results of running the image
    processor to Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud Datastore when ready. \\

    To enable scalable image processing performance, it is desirable to enable many VMs to run image processor
    applications at once. In order to do this efficiently without redundancy, it is necessary to ensure that
    multiple VMs do not try to process the same images. For that reason, image processor manager instances must
    mark image files as pending processing before another instances of the image processor manager can queue
    them for processing. Without implementing this functionality, little to no performance improvements can be
    expected by deploying multiple image processor manager nodes. \\

\subsection{Eclipse Simulator}

  \subsubsection{User Interface View [Governed by Viewpoint 2.3.1 ]}
  The user interface shall utilize 2D animated depictions of
  the Sun and the Moon as they appear at a user specified
  time and location. In addition, the user interface will
  contain background imagery such as a city or hillside
  landscape. There will also be a time slider, a location
  input, and a time display for users to interact with or
  view. \\

  \subsubsection{Operating Performance View [Governed by Viewpoint 2.3.2]}
  The simulator will have low loading times to ensure fast
  performance for most users. Additionally, the simulator
  will need to respond in a timely matter when users are
  interacting with the module. \\

  \subsubsection{Eclipse Accuracy View [Governed by Viewpoint 2.3.3]}
  The simulator shall be accurate enough for any location in
  the continental United States. This accuracy includes
  accurate relative Moon and Sun sizes, positions in the
  rendered scene, and positions relative to one another. \\

    \textbf{Type:} Subsystem \\
    \textbf{Purpose:} The purpose of this subsystem is to download and return a list of images from Datastore
    to be processed by the image processor application. It will use Datastore transactions to ensure that each
    image in this list is marked as pending processing before it can be retrieved by another image processor
    manager instance. The max number of image files retrieved will be determined by the number of image
    processor processes that are going to be launched. This value will be a parameter of the image list
    downloader subsystem. \\

    \subsubsection{Image Downloader}
    \textbf{Type:} Subsystem \\
    \textbf{Purpose:} The purpose of this subsystem is to download and save individual image files. It will

    concurrently to download the images in the list. \\

    \subsubsection{Result Uploader}
    \textbf{Type:} Subsystem \\
    \textbf{Purpose:} The purpose of this subsystem is to upload an individual processed image to Google Cloud

    \textbf{Purpose:} The purpose of this system is to coordinate element 4.2.4, the \textit{Results Uploader}.
    It will use the Python multiprocessing module to launch multiple instances of the \textit{Results Uploader}
    concurrently to upload the output of the image processor. \\

    \subsubsection{Image Processor Invoker}
    \textbf{Type:} System \\
    \textbf{Purpose:} The purpose of this system is to invoke multiple instances of the image processor
    application concurrently using the Python subprocess module. It will distribute images to process over
    multiple image processor processes to increase throughput. The number of image processor processes will be
    determined by the number of cores on the host VM. \\

    the \textit{Result Uploader Manager}, and the \textit{Image Processor Invoker}. It will run these systems
    in parallel so that images are downloaded/uploaded at the same time that other images are being
    processed. \\

%% Section 6
\section{Design Rationale}

\subsection{Image Processor}

The design of this system is based on needs surrounding accuracy, speed, and
ability to interface with other components in the larger system. As was detailed
in the technology review, we made certain decisions about what tools and
algorithms to use based on the specific requirements of our system. The use of
these tools has necessarily shaped the design of this application.\\

Additional information regarding design rationale can be found in the 'Purpose'
section of the design elements.

\subsection{Image Processor Manager}

    \subsubsection{High Level System Design}
    From a high level the system is designed to be highly parallel with the aim of achieving as close to
    100\% CPU utilization on all cores as possible. In order to achieve this it is necessary to ensure that
    images to process are downloaded ahead of the time they're needed, this way the latency of their download
    time is hidden by processing other images. It is also necessary to ensure that processed images do not back
    up. The design elements outlined above fit together to form a system that naturally supports a very high
    level of concurrency. Subsystems to handle individual tasks are built and then multiple instances of these
    subsystems can be launched concurrently with different parameters. These subsystems are called by their
    parent systems. \\

    \subsubsection{Process Based Concurrency}
    As outlined in detail in our technology review, to achieve true multi-core concurrency in Python, use of
    process based concurrency such as that used in the built-in multiprocessing module is necessary. This is
    because multi-thread execution in Python is severely throttled by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which
    essentially forces serialization of the execution of concurrent threads. \\

    \subsubsection{Motivation for separation of Image List Downloader and Image Downloader}
    Design element 4.2.1, the \textit{Image List Downloader} is separated from design element 4.2.2, the
    \textit{Image Downloader} as lists of all the images that need to be downloaded at a given time form
    relatively small collections of data. Therefore, it is more efficient to make a single Datastore query to
    retrieve all the images that need to be downloaded, rather than retrieving these one at a time using
    separate queries. As the image files themselves are quite large, these still need to be retrieved
    individually. In fact, the Google Cloud Client Library for Python does not support the download of multiple
    files from Cloud Storage using a single API call. On top of this constraint, downloading the actual image
    files individually ensures that we are able to establish a large number of concurrent connections to Cloud
    Storage to saturate the VM network interface as much as possible and achieve very high overall download
    speeds. \\

\subsection{Eclipse Simulator}


The goals for the simulator were to provide a fast and
responsive experience to the user while providing
scientifically accurate results. One main concern with this
is that the time to compute information regarding the Sun
and Moon must be quick enough to not pose any significant
delay for the rest of the simulator. \\

We decided to utilize the MVC architecture since model and
view components can be exchanged without compromising the
whole system. System designer only need to account how the
components interact with each other to update the system.
In the technology review, we compared two libraries: Suncalc
and Ephemeris. Initially, we chose SunCalc as the better
library due to better documentation and ease of use. After
further testing, the results that Ephemeris was providing
were much better which spurred the change to utilizing
Ephemeris as our support in ephemeris computations. \\

Additionally, we chose to utilize a scalar vector graphics
format due to sub-element event processing and being easily
to move the Sun and Moon around as animations. \\
